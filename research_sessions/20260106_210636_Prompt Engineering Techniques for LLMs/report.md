## Executive Summary

Prompt engineering has emerged as a critical technique for maximizing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. This research summary synthesizes findings from three comprehensive survey papers published in 2023-2024, covering 58+ distinct prompting techniques. The key finding is that strategic prompt design can dramatically improve LLM performance—for example, Chain-of-Thought prompting achieves 90.2% accuracy on math benchmarks, while Tree-of-Thoughts achieves 74% success rates compared to 4% with standard prompting on complex reasoning tasks. The most impactful techniques include Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for reasoning, Self-Consistency for reliability, Tree/Graph of Thoughts for complex problem-solving, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for reducing hallucinations.

## Key Findings

1. **1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting is the Most Impactful Technique**: CoT prompting, which encourages step-by-step reasoning, dramatically improves performance on logical and mathematical tasks. Zero-Shot CoT can be triggered simply by adding 'Let's think step by step' to prompts. PaLM 540B achieved 90.2% accuracy on GSM8K math benchmark using CoT.

2. **2. Self-Consistency Improves Reliability**: By generating multiple reasoning paths and selecting the majority answer, Self-Consistency combined with CoT shows 17.9% improvement on GSM8K, 11.0% on SVAMP, and 12.2% on AQuA benchmarks.

3. **3. Tree/Graph of Thoughts Enable Complex Problem-Solving**: ToT achieved 74% success rate vs CoT's 4% on the Game of 24 task. These techniques allow exploration of multiple reasoning paths with backtracking and self-evaluation capabilities.

4. **4. Foundational Techniques Remain Essential**: Clear instructions, role-prompting, and appropriate use of few-shot examples form the foundation. Notably, exemplar ordering can cause accuracy to vary from sub-50% to 90%+, highlighting the importance of prompt design.

5. **5. RAG and Verification Chains Reduce Hallucinations**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge, while Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) uses systematic 4-step verification to improve factual accuracy.

6. **6. Zero-Shot Can Outperform Few-Shot**: Contrary to intuition, well-crafted zero-shot prompts sometimes outperform few-shot prompts—examples help models recall learned tasks rather than teach new ones.

7. **7. Emotion Prompting Shows Surprising Effectiveness**: Adding emotional stimuli to prompts (e.g., 'This is important to my career') improved performance by 8% on instruction induction and 115% on BIG-Bench tasks.

8. **8. Decomposition Techniques Handle Complexity**: Least-to-Most prompting and DECOMP break complex problems into manageable sub-tasks, enabling generalization to harder problems than those shown in examples.
